    "><hr>\n",
    "> <a href='www.twitter.com/dog_rates'>WeRateDogs</a> (later referred to as <b>WRD</b> in this document) is a Twitter account, created by Matt Nelson, that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent\">\"they're good dogs Brent\"</a>. WRD has over 9 million followers and has received international media coverage.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Here are a few snippet's of WRD's Twitter account 👇🏾 \n",

    ">![](img/wrd_tw_home.png)   |  ![](img/wdr-tw-tweet.png)\n",
    "> \n",
    "> This project focuses on actualizing and accentuating the three data wrangling techniques on the WRD Twitter archive as part of Udacity's Data Analysis curriculum. WRD downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for use in this project. The archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. Two other datasets that will be used in this study include a `tsv file` provided by Udacity that includes results obtained from running images of the in WRD's tweets through a <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/neural-networks\">neural network</a> and additional tweet data that I will have to scrape using the  <a href=\"https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api\">`Twitter API`</a>."

    "> Based on the data that I will be acquiring, I figured I would have to deduce any actionable insights from the `ratings`, number of engagements in the form of `retweets` 🔁 and, `favorite`❤️, the `predicted_dog_breed` derived from Udacity's neural network test, `timestamps` to ascertain changes over a period of time and `text` from the the tweets for a sentiment analysis study on WRD.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> After a meticulous hypotheses construction process, I decided to pull on my Inspector Gadget coat on and investigate the following questions:\n",
    "> 1. Which dog breeds obtained the highest ratings on average? \n",
    "> 1. Which dog breeds have attracted the most engagement on WRD over the time period in question (2015-2017)? \n",
    "> 1. What are the most used words on WRD? (I will print out a cool [wordcloud](https://www.google.com/search?q=wordcloud) for this)\n",
    "> 1. Generally, what's the sentiment given off by WRD? Is it positive, neutral or negative? Is it subjective (personal and opinionated) or objective (factual)?"
