## Description
><hr>
> <a href='www.twitter.com/dog_rates'>WeRateDogs</a> (later referred to as <b>WRD</b> in this document) is a Twitter account, created by Matt Nelson, that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent">"they're good dogs Brent"</a>. WRD has over 9 million followers and has received international media coverage.
>
> Here are a few snippet's of WRD's Twitter account üëáüèæ

> 
> This project focuses on actualizing and accentuating the three data wrangling techniques on the WRD Twitter archive as part of Udacity's Data Analysis curriculum. WRD downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for use in this project. The archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. Two other datasets that will be used in this study include a `tsv file` provided by Udacity that includes results obtained from running images of the in WRD's tweets through a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/neural-networks">neural network</a> and additional tweet data that I will have to scrape using the  <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api">`Twitter API`</a>.

### Hypotheses and Pre-EDA remarks
><hr>
> Based on the data that I will be acquiring, I figured I would have to deduce any actionable insights from the `ratings`, number of engagements in the form of `retweets` üîÅ and, `favorite`‚ù§Ô∏è, the `predicted_dog_breed` derived from Udacity's neural network test, `timestamps` to ascertain changes over a period of time and `text` from the the tweets for a sentiment analysis study on WRD.
>
> After a meticulous hypotheses construction process, I decided to pull on my Inspector Gadget coat on and investigate the following questions:
> 1. Which dog breeds obtained the highest ratings on average? 
> 1. Which dog breeds have attracted the most engagement on WRD over the time period in question (2016-2017)? 
> 1. What are the most used words on WRD? (I will print out a cool [wordcloud](https://www.google.com/search?q=wordcloud) for this)
> 1. Generally, what's the sentiment given off by WRD? Is it positive, neutral or negative? Is it subjective (personal and opinionated) or objective (factual)?

### Modules used in this notebook:
><hr>
>
> I've used Python and many of it's rich features to come up with my solutions. The following are the dependencies required to run this application:
>* `Pandas`
>* `Numpy`
>* `Tweepy`
>* `Requests`
>* `Plotly`
>* `TextBlob`
>* `WordCloud`
>* `Python-dotenv`
>* `re`
>* `_json`
>* `os`
>* `unittest`
>
> You can install them using `requirements.txt` file or `environment.yml` file in the `dependencies`. Run either one of these at the root of your project depending on your environment manager:
> * Pip: `pip install -r dependencies/requirements.txt`
> * Anaconda: `conda env create -f dependencies/environment.yml `


```python
# import required modules
import requests
import tweepy as twpy
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from textblob import TextBlob
from wordcloud import WordCloud
import _json
import unittest

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import os
import re

#ensure all Plotly plots render while offline
from plotly.offline import iplot, init_notebook_mode
init_notebook_mode(connected=True)
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import plotly.express as px
```


<script type="text/javascript">
window.PlotlyConfig = {MathJaxConfig: 'local'};
if (window.MathJax) {MathJax.Hub.Config({SVG: {font: "STIX-Web"}});}
if (typeof require !== 'undefined') {
require.undef("plotly");
requirejs.config({
    paths: {
        'plotly': ['https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-2.9.0.min']
    }
});
require(['plotly'], function(Plotly) {
    window._Plotly = Plotly;
});
}
</script>



## Data Wrangling
> I will acquire, appraise and floss all my datasets to the best fit for this study using the various installed modules. Each process will make use of custom functions to attempt cut on clunky and repetitive code. 

### Gather
><hr>
>
>This project involves obtaining three separate datasets from various sources. I will be using different methods to obtain each dataset as specified below.
> This custom function built from Pandas' `read_csv()` method will be used to read various datasets. The `header` and `names` parameters will override each other depending on which of the two is set to `None` by default or passed as an arg.


```python
#custom function to read data into Pandas DataFrame
def open_set(csv, sep=',', header=0, names=[]):
    df = pd.read_csv(csv, low_memory=False, sep=sep, names=names, header=header)
    
    return df
```

#### **`twitter-archive-enhanced` table**
><hr>
>
> WRD's Twitter archive data was provided by Udacity and **downloaded manually through the Chrome browser.** I will import the data locally from my storage in the `data` folder using `open_set()`.


```python
df_tw_arch = open_set('data/twitter-archive-enhanced.csv', header=0, names=None)
df_tw_arch.head()
```

#### **`image-predictions` table**

>The `image_predictions.tsv` file is present in each tweet, according to a neural network. It is hosted on Udacity's servers and will be **downloaded programmatically using the Requests library**.

#### **Obtaining additional tweet data from `Twitter API` using Python's `Tweepy`** module
>
>* For our final dataset, we will be using the `Twitter API` and Python's `Tweepy` library to query Twitter for each tweet's **retweet_count**, **favorite_count**, **geo data** and **language data**. These attributes will later be used to generate insights.
>
>* **<span style="color:#add8e6">Note that you need either a combination of your consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_key and access_key secret or a bearer_token to query data through the Twitter API.**</span>
>
>* I put to use Python's `dotenv` and `os` libraries to cache my `bearer_token` from a secret file and load its value using the `load_dotenv()` and `os.getenv()` methods respectively.


```python
# Cache the file into the environment
load_dotenv('.env')
```

>* I opted for a custom function to obtain tweet data through Tweepy's [**_get_status()_**](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.5.0/api.html) method. The `tweet_id` from  the `df_tw_arch` dataset will be converted to a list and passed into the function. Each tweet's JSON data that I require for this project will be parsed into a new file (`tweet_json.txt`) and appended one after the other.


```python
# custom to extract tweet data
def get_tweets(ids):
    
    # Authorization to bearer_token
    auth = twpy.OAuth2BearerHandler(os.getenv('BEARER_TOKEN'))
    
    # Calling api
    api = twpy.API(auth, wait_on_rate_limit = True)
    
    # Empty Array
    del_tweets = []
    
    # Start a code timer for the loop
    for tw_id in ids: 
        try:
            tw_status = api.get_status(tw_id, tweet_mode='extended')._json
            try:
                f = open('data/tweet_json.txt', 'a+', encoding='utf-8')
                f.write(f"{tw_status['id']},{tw_status['retweet_count']},{tw_status['favorite_count']},{tw_status['geo']},{tw_status['lang']}\n")
            finally:
                f.close()

### Assess 
><hr>
>
> * I will use a spreadsheet program for my visual assessment (Google Sheets, MS Excel etc) and employ Pandas' and Numpy libraries for my programmatic assessment. I will be focusing on quality and tidiness checks. These will include missing, duplicate, incorrect, corrupted and messy data records.
>
> * Inferences and mental checks will be made following each assessment procedure. 

#### **`df_tw_arch`**
<hr>

##### Visual Assessment

>* Here is an screenshot of the Twitter archive opened in Excel
>
>|![tw_arch.csv](img/tw_arch.png)|
>|:--:|
>|<b> The Twitter Archive Dataset</b>|

> * There are a few columns with glaringly empty fields: `in_reply_to_status`, `in_reply_to_user_id`, `retweeted_status_user_id`, `retweeted_status_timestamp` **(Quality Issue)**
> * At a glance, `rating_denominator` seems to have only one unique value and hence no insights can be obtained from that column. I will investigate this further. **(Quality issue)**
>* The four columns describing the "stage" the dog is in should be transposed into one column. **(Tidiness issue)**

>|<b>The Image Predictions Dataset</b>|

> * Some rows have no `True` prediction values and innacurate dog_breed predictions in their `p1`, `p2` and `p3` columns so therefore will be rendered useless in any EDA involving dog species as a factor. **(Quality issue)**
>
> * Predictions should be represented as a percentage rather than a float with multiple decimal numbers for improved legibility but this is a minor issue. **(Quality issue)**
>
> * The `p1_conf` should be the only prediction value retained since it is the closest to 1 (it is the most trustworthy "dog identifier") in the dataset. **(Tidiness issue)** 
>
> * `img_num` column is unnecessary since we have links to the images. **(Tidiness issue)**

> * A number of predictions are not dog species. These will have to be filtered out of the dataset to ensure we have only records that are dog species. **(Quality Issue)**
<hr>

### Clean
> * I will make a copy of each dataset and clean them separately going through every issue and tackling them with code, and testing to see if my solutions crafted the datasets into the form tha I require.
<hr>


```python
#Make copies of the original dataframes 
df_copy_arch = df_tw_arch.copy()
df_copy_data = df_tw_data.copy()
df_copy_img = df_image_pred.copy()
```

#### `df_tw_arch`
<hr>

##### Define

> **(Tidiness issue)**: Some of the fields in the table bring about repetitiveness and provide no insights at all. I chose to drop these fields due to the following reasons:
>* `in_reply_to_status_id`, `in_reply_to_user_id`,`retweeted_status_id`, `retweeted_status_user_id`,`retweeted_status_timestamp` -> These fields can be aggregated as pointers to WRD's original tweets. They cause an juxtaposition of duplicated variables in the dataset and should be dropped.
>
>* `floofer` -> Based on the definition of the various [dog stages]() a floofer is basically any dog. We're _already dealing_ with a dataset about dogs so there really isn't any insight we could pull from this description as a column on it's own.
>
> Pandas' `drop()`method will be effective for this operation.

##### Code


```python
#Set inplace=True to save your changes
df_copy_arch.drop(columns=['in_reply_to_status_id', 'in_reply_to_user_id','retweeted_status_id', 'retweeted_status_user_id','retweeted_status_timestamp', 'expanded_urls','floofer'], inplace=True)
```

##### Test
> I will conduct assertion tests to confirm none of the dropped columns are in the dataframe

>**(Quality Issue)**: Dealing with the missing values in the `retweet_count` and `favorite_count`
>* Some of the tweets in this archive were retweets made by WRD and retweets by the same count never have the same amount of retweets and likes as the original tweet hence why Twitter's API pulled them with 0 likes but maintained their retweet_count values. Here's an example of one such tweet in the dataset:
>
> <p align="center"><img src="img/retweet.png"/></p>
>
> Weird, right? 
> * I have no workaround for this at the moment so I will fill these values with the mean of the `favorite_count` column.
> * I will employ Pandas's `mean()` and `fillna()` methods for this process.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Q1: Which dog breeds have been awarded the highest ratings?
>
> I attempt to investigate how WRD has awarded ratings by dog breeds. I will use the `dog_breed` column to aggregate mean values for all the species and plot visualizations to this effect. 


```python
df_master.dog_breed.value_counts()
```




    Golden Retriever      150
    Labrador Retriever    100
    Pembroke               89
    Chihuahua              83
    Pug                    57
                         ... 
    Scotch Terrier          1
    Entlebucher             1
    Japanese Spaniel        1
    Standard Schnauzer      1
    Clumber                 1
    Name: dog_breed, Length: 111, dtype: int64



> * Assuming that the neural network was accurate, Golden Retrievers are the most common breeds rated by WRD in our dataset. 
>
> * For this analysis, I will only use records that have values in the `dog_breed` column so all records that have null values in this column will not be used.

> * Dogs are rated fairly well by WRD, seeing that the mean is above their usual denominator of 10.
> * There is a huge disparity between the third quartile ratings and the highest ranking.This floofer must be h\*cking amazing
There seems to be a linear correlation between `retweet_count` and `favorite_count`
> * For the ratings, I will create a separate dataframe and sort them in descending order.

> Inferences:

> 1. Terriers, Pyrennes, Borzoi and the Husky are pretty popular dogs.
> 1. The Japanese Spaniel is the lowest ranked dog breed on WRD.


```python

```

> * I will have to reset the index to visualize my dataframe.


![](img/top10rated.png)


Inference

> * If you're have an owner of a Clumber, a Terrier or Great Pyrenees, chances are WRD would rate your dog pretty highly were you to submit a photo of your floofer to their account.
<hr>

### Q2: Which dog breeds have attracted the most engagement on WRD over the time period in question (2016-2017)?

> I will visualize the engagements by two spectrums: 
> * Retweets üîÅ
> * Favorites ‚ù§Ô∏è

#### Retweets

> * As done before with the ratings,I will create a separate dataframe for the retweets count sorted in descending order.

> Inferences:
> * The Eskimo dog,
 Irish Water Spaniel, Afghan Hound, Basset and Norwegian Elkhound were the **most likable dog breeds in 2016 based off of WRD's Twitter metrics**
> * The Ibizan hound, Australian Terrier, Border Terrier, Cairn and Groenendael	**gained the least popularity in WRD's audience in 2016**

### Q3: What are the most used words on WRD?
> Word Clouds (also known as wordle, word collage, or tag cloud) are visual representations of words that give greater prominence to words that appear more frequently.
> The goal is to understand how WRD's author and audience feel about dogs and topics revolving around dogs.
> I will use the cleaned text to figure this out in addition to Python's WordCloud library
<hr>

> * I intend to filter a dataset that does not contain any null values in the `text` column. The `timestamp` field will be used for a future analysis of sentiment by years.

# query only non-null text records into a new dataset

> * The most commonly used words on WRD are "pupper", "Meet", "happy", "h*ckin", "doggo", "pup" etc
> * Generally, a lot of positive words are used on WRD's Twitter. 
<hr>

### Q4: Generally, what's the sentiment given off by WRD? Is it positive, neutral or negative? Is it subjective (personal and opinionated) or objective (factual)?
> I will use a binary classifier using the Twitter data to detect the sentiment of each tweet. The input data is the text and the library in use will be Python's TextBlob.
>
> I will get the score of each tweet's polarity. Polarity is the output that lies between [-1,1], where -1 refers to negative sentiment and +1 refers to positive sentiment.
>
> Subjectivity quantifies the amount of personal opinion and factual information contained in the text. The higher subjectivity means that the text contains personal opinion rather than factual information. Subjectivity output that lies within [0,1] and refers to personal opinions and judgments.
>
> I will use two custom functions to obtain these scores into new columns named `subjectivity` and `polarity` respectively.
<hr>


```python
# Custom function to obtain subjectivity
def getSubjectivity(text):
    return TextBlob(text).sentiment.subjectivity

# Custom function to obtain polarity
def getPolarity(text):
    return TextBlob(text).sentiment.polarity

# Apply custom functions to the `df_texts` dataframe 
df_texts['subjectivity'] = df_texts.text.apply(getSubjectivity)
df_texts['polarity'] = df_texts.text.apply(getPolarity)

> Inferences:
> * WRD is generally a positive Twitter account since it's mean polarity is above 0.
> * As expected, WRD tweets are authored to be in between factuality and opinion when describing and dashing out ratings to various dogs on their account. This balanced score speaks to why they are rather popular. 
> * We can infer that tweets with a `Neutral` attitude lack any subjectivity at all.

> Follow-up:
> * I will create a custom function to get a better read of each tweet's polarity in a new column named `Attitude`.
> * The logic will be dependent on the polarity score such that values below 0 will be awarded `Negative` attitude, values that are 0 will be awarded `Neutral` attitude while all values above 0 will be awarded `Positive` attitude.


```python
def getAttitude(score):
    if score < 0:
        return 'Negative'
    elif score == 0:
        return 'Neutral'
    else:
        return'Positive'

df_texts['attitude'] = df_texts.polarity.apply(getAttitude)
```


```python
df_texts.attitude.value_counts()
```




    Positive    1238
    Neutral      624
    Negative     494
    Name: attitude, dtype: int64



> Inferences:
> * **Most of WRD's tweets have got a positive attitude**. üê∂üôÇ


```python
px.scatter(x=df_texts.polarity, y=df_texts.subjectivity, color=df_texts.attitude, title="Distribution of WeRateDogs tweets' sentiment analysis", labels={'x':'Polarity Score', 'y': 'Subjectivity Score', 'color': 'Attitude'})
```

> Inferences:
> * **The scatter is more skewed to the right. This confirms that WRD is generally a positive account** 
> * Subjectivity sets the precendece for polarity in each of WRD's tweet. The higher the subjectivity i.e. opinionated rather than factual a tweet is, the higher the chances it emits either a positive or negative sentiment. There is no in-between i.e. neutrality but chances are higher that it will give off a positive sentiment rather than a negative one.

## Limitations
> * A number of predictions from the neural network seemed to have been inaccurate going by the descriptions given in the tweet texts.
> * A few tweets had since been deleted from 2015 and so I couldn't get the exact number of favorites and retweets for those tweets.
> * The `Name` column was marred with inaccuracies making it pretty hard to even come up with a model for generating analyses on dog names with the highest ratings.
> * The data used for this study ranges from the years 2015 to 2017 so it is rather outdated. It is difficult to tell whether these insights would hold water in the current time.
